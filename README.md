*In progress*  (Group project for uni)

(Hi work recruiting people! This is a project that's in progress for a uni project I'm in the middle of. Because of this it's very rough, but you can
see that I'm capable of using GitHub with multiple others on the same project ;) If you want to see something more complete, check out one of my 
other projects please!)

A prototype for an Emergency Patient Care Record creation system.
My first go at using React-Native and developing for ios and android. 
We're currently carrying out this project as an Agile group with daily standups, weekly meetings with our client and restrospectives. 
We use Trello to organize our tasks but we also have a post-it board going because it kind of just helps everyone focus better and moving the post-its along
is very satisfying!

Come back when this project is complete!
